## Phase III: AI Chatbot Architecture

### AI Integration Principles
- Use OpenAI Agents SDK for conversational AI
- MCP server exposes task operations as tools
- Stateless server design - all state in database
- Natural language understanding for task commands
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

### Technology Stack
- Frontend: OpenAI ChatKit
- AI Framework: OpenAI Agents SDK
- MCP: Official Python MCP SDK
- Backend: FastAPI (extended from Phase II)

### MCP Tools Design
- Each tool is stateless
- Tools call existing database operations
- Tools return JSON responses
- Error messages are clear and actionable

### Conversation Management
- Conversations stored in database
- Messages persist across sessions
- No server-side session state
- Each request is independent
